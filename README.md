# Introduction

## 

Quality Analysts is an important role in ThoughtWorks that helps shape the software delivery. 

Quality Analysts possesses keen eye for details and have a curious mind. 

Quality Analysts are usually responsible for detailed functionality testing with edge cases. They help achieve fast feedback by levaraging stable  test automation suite.
They are a key to achieving efficient and continuous quality software delivery.

At ThoughtWorks, Quality oriented teams relies heavily on Quality Analysts throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

In this program, we plan to groom our people into someone who wants to grow in the test automation field, so that they have enough breadth with basics to be able to contribute in a project for Quality Analyst related work right away and be able to deep dive into more about specific topic further themselves.

The goal here is to move from No experience to "Learning" stage in the selected key competencies required for a baseline Quality Analyst.

## How are we going to do it?

So, we should now be on the same page around intention of this program. Let's look at how we will achieve this.

This program will last for 16 weeks.Â 

Every two weeks, we are going to ask you to do some homework beforehand (Maximum 4-6 hrs), and then we will have practice session with your assigned coach every alternate week. During practice session, you will hack together/discuss with your coach & practice what you learned by following pre-planned exercises together.

Below is the high level timeline for each week.

* Week 1-2: Software Development Life Cycle, Agile processes
* Week 3-4: Agile testing
* Week 5-6: Testing Types and Software Testing techniques
* Week 7-8: Introduction to web development, JavaScript and Git (source version control)
* Week 9-10: Test automation concept and tools
