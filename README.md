# Introduction

Quality Analysts is an important role in ThoughtWorks that helps shape the software delivery.

Quality Analyst is an important role in ThoughtWorks that helps us deliver better software products. 

Quality Analysts are usually responsible for detailed functionality testing with edge cases. They help teams achieve fast feedback by levaraging stable test automation suite.
They are a key to achieving efficient and continuous quality software delivery.

At ThoughtWorks, quality oriented teams relies heavily on Quality Analysts throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

In this program, we plan to groom our people into someone who wants to grow in the test automation field, so that they have enough breadth with basics to be able to contribute in a project as a Quality Analyst and they should be able to deep dive into more about specific topic further themselves.

The goal here is to move from "No experience" to "Learning" stage in the selected key competencies required for a baseline Quality Analyst.

## How are we going to do it?

So, we should now be on the same page around intention of this program. Let's look at how we will achieve this.

This program will last for 16 weeks.

Every two weeks, we are choosing one topic & we will ask you to do some homework beforehand (Maximum 4-6 hrs) for that topic.
Then at the end of 2 weeks, we will have practice session with your assigned coach. During practice session, you will hack together/discuss with your coach & practice what you learned by following pre-planned exercises together.

Below is the high level timeline for each week.

* Week 1-2: Software Development Life Cycle, Agile processes
* Week 3-4: Agile testing
* Week 5-6: Testing Types and Software Testing techniques
* Week 7-8: Introduction to web development, JavaScript and Git \(source version control\)
* Week 9-10: Test automation concept and tools
* Week 11-12: Introduction to Gauge
* Week 13-14: Basic of Application programming interface \(API\) and Path to production. 
* Week 15-16: Showcase
